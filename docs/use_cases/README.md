# Pretrained Models (constantly updating)

We provide pretrain models in a number of datasets and modalities. Currently, the following databases are provided:

* [AffWild](AffWild)
* [RECOLA](RECOLA)
* [SEWA](SEWA)

## SEWA

The following tables provide results on the SEWA dataset (in terms of CCC) for the prediction of arousal and valence. In parenthesis are the performances obtained on the development set. Also the link to the pretrain models is provided.

### Visual modality

| ResNet18  | 0.484 (0.544) | 0.591 (0.655) | download |
| ResNet34  | 0.567 (0.584) | 0.612 (0.657) | download |
| ResNet50  | 0.620 (0.641) | 0.670 (0.639) | download |
| MobileNet | 0.433 (0.622) | 0.628 (0.639) | download |
